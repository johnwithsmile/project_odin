  chocolate chips on top once the pancakes are on the griddle instead of folding
  them into the batter

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>¾ cup milk</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
  <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

  <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
  <li>cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    To make the buttermilk: Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for
    5 minutes to sour the milk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing
    bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until well
    combined; add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate
    chips. The pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until
    bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula,
    and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Repeat with
    remaining batter. Serve immediately.
